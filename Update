The Discerning User’s Guide to F´ (F prime)

What is F-prime? 
F´ is an embedded systems framework developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory for use in space-based missions.
Goal: make the development of flight-quality embedded software simple, easy, and fun. In other words it reduces the complexity and overhead to develop such systems.


Important features in F Prime:
Component architecture with well-defined interfaces
C++ framework providing core capabilities like queues, threads, and operating-system abstraction
Tools for designing systems and automatically generating code from systems design
A standard library of flight-worthy components
Testing tools for unit and system-level testing





SCALA
Side effect: A function is said to be having side effects if it does any of the following other than just returning a result: Modifies an existing variable. Reads from a file or writes to a file. Modifies a data structure (e.g., array, list).

The object keyword creates a new singleton type, which is like a class that only has a single named instance.

Scala has no equivalent to Java’s static keyword, and an object is often used in Scala where you might use a class with static members in Java.

Scala is also a functional language in the sense that every function is a value. Scala provides a lightweight syntax for defining anonymous functions, it supports higher-order functions, it allows functions to be nested, and it supports currying.
