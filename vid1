Fetch: Load an instruction into the instruction register 
Decode: Look at the instruction in the instruction register
Execute: actually execute the instruction

Above that is 5 states that can only support 3 instructions. In reality your going to need a separate state for every instruction

One Problem with finite state machines is they can get very big very quickly
